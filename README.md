# ðŸŽµ Artificial Grammar-Based Chord Sequence Generator

This repository contains a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based Python tool for generating musically informed chord and pitch sequences. It simulates probabilistic musical grammar, with an emphasis on realistic transitions, constrained pitch repetition, and harmonically meaningful sequences â€” suitable for auditory neuroscience, BCI stimulus creation, or music cognition experiments.

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

To generate synthetic chord sequences governed by a structured probabilistic grammar. These sequences can be used as stimuli for behavioral or neuroimaging studies investigating musical expectation, prediction, or perception.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Hidden Markov model (HMM)â€“based state transitions between chords
- Transition matrix tailored to reflect harmonic structure
- Constrained pitch selection with probabilistic weighting
- Repetition-avoidance logic for pitch realism
- Output in both **chord sequences** and **flattened pitch sequences**
- Probabilistic weighting favors cadences and closure on final chords

## ðŸ“œ Script Overview

### `1st_grammar_seq_generator.py`

This script includes:

- `generate_chord_sequence(length)`:  
  Constructs a sequence of chords based on an HMM-like transition matrix.

- `pitch_from_chord_sequence(chord_sequence)`:  
  Samples pitches from each chord with weighted probabilities and repetition suppression.

- `main()`:  
  Generates a batch of sequences and stores them in memory. Configurable for experimental batch runs.

---


## ðŸ’¡ Future Directions

- MIDI/audio export of sequences
- Integration with timbre synthesis engines
- Visualization of transition probabilities
- Extension to polyphonic or rhythmic structures
